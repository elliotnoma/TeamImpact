### Hacking on Sparkfun 9dof block for Edison (LSM9DS0)

Some initial code to get data out of the Sparkfun 9 Degrees of Freedom
Block for Intel Edison. The block contains a LSM9DS0 9DOF IMU with a
3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope, and a 3-axis magnetometer.

The code is currently just hacks, might grow into a library. Lots of
inspiration has been taken from the
[LSM9DS0_Breakout](https://github.com/sparkfun/LSM9DS0_Breakout)
project. All the magic byte values are from the [LSM9DS0 datasheet](http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/DM00087365.pdf).

Feel free to use this code in any way you want: let's say "New BSD license".

#### Programs

`test`: prints out either sensor values or flight dynamic parameters (yaw,
roll & pitch). Can also dump all configuration register contents. test will
use bias files generated by the calibration utilities, if they exist.

`calibrate-acc-gyro`: produces calibration data for accelerometer and
gyroscope. Device should stand motionless on level and stable
surface during the calibration.

`calibrate-mag`: produces calibration data for magnetometer. Device
should be turned to every direction during the calibration.
